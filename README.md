# sm64ex-extended-soundbank
An extended soundbank with every sm64 instrument in it. (It is possible to compile it now!)

You will need to change some files on the decomp repo in order for it to work. A special tool might be needed to make m64 files that can use every instrument, since there's only up to 127 MIDI patches, there's ~66 instruments that go unused normally.
