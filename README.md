# sm64ex-extended-soundbank
An extended soundbank with every sm64 instrument in it. assemble_sound.py can't compile it so it's here in case there's any way to compile it in the future

If you know any way to fix it, feel free to PR your changes and I'll take a look.
If the problem is part of assemble_sound.py itself, then I don't know, if you've got a fix, PR it to the sm64ex repo I suppose?
